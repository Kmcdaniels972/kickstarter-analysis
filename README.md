# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Review the outcomes, pledged & goal amounts, fundraiser durations of Campaigns hosted on the Kickstarter Platform. 
After reviewing and organzing the data, see if the success of the campagins are related to the launch date and goal.

### Purpose
My client, Louise, wants to use Kickstarter as her crowdfunding platform to fundraise a play that she wants to direct.
She wants to know her potential success rate with her current goal amount of $12,000.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After examining the trend lines, campagins launched between the months May and June were more successful in reaching their set goals on Kickstarter. 
In contrast campagins launched during the months January, June, July, and October have about the same number of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From comparing Outcomes of campagins based on the goals that were set, I have concluded that the campagins' who have a goal $10,000 and over have a lower success rate due asking for too much.
The ending pledged amounts are less than $2,000 at the end of the deadline.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges that occurred were selecting the proper filters to display the desired information, converting the deadline & launched date data point from Unix Timestamps to short date, 
confirming all needed data was presented on the graphs.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I do advide to reassess the amount needed for the campaign and if there is anyway that it could be scaled back to make the fundraiser goal more achieveable
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I would advise to launch her fundraiser during May or June to ensure that she has a higher probability to reach her campaign goal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of the dataset do not provide what incentive the campaigns used to make backers more likely to pledge and there is little to no knowledge of how the other data points (blurb, staff pick, spotlight) could have affected the outcome of the campagins.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The failed and successful Kickstarter campagins of Great Britian
Outcomes based on Goals graph mapping out the failed campagins to see the distribution or trend
Use a graph dipicting the Outcomes based on the durations of the campaigns
